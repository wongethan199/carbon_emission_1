Before running the main.py on streamlit make sure that on the bash (NOT Codespace) terminal you have already run the installation commands ` pip install geopy ` and ` pip install searoute ` as they are not builtin python modules.  

To access the bash terminal, go to the "terminal" tab at the bottom of your streamlit project and click "bash" on the bottom right. Then run the two commands.
