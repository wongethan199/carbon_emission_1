before running the main.py on streamlit make sure that on the bash (NOT Codespace) terminal you have run ` pip install geopy ` and ` pip install searoute ` as they are not builtin python modules
to access the bash terminal, go to the "terminal" tab at the bottom of your streamlit project and click "bash" on the bottom right
